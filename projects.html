            <h4> Trigeminal Smell Detection Glasses - 2019 </h4>
            <p>
              Working with Jas Brooks at the University of Chicago's Human-Computer Integration Lab,
              I've been building a device that uses three gas sensors to triangulate the location of a
              gas source, and then informs the user of its direction relative to themselves using EMS
              on the trigeminal nerve. This project hopes to allow people without a sense of smell to
              simulate what it is like to smell, by making use of the nervous system rather than smell receptors.

            <h4> Online Biometric Response Integration & Display - 2018 </h4>
            <p>
              Made while working for UnitedHealthGroup R&D. Integrates Movesense biometric sensors with Google Cloud and a chart display to give
              live feedback over the internet of a user's ECG, temperature, and heart rate data. Could be used by doctors
              and nurses to monitor the vitals of patients without requiring them to be at a hospital 24/7.
